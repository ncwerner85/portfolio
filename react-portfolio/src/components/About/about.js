            Hello my name is Nicholas and I am an inspiring web developer. I am
            new to coding but I am very excited to learn and start on a new
            adventure.
          </p>
          <p>
            My career thus far has taken me from human resources to the fast
            paced world of recruiting/staffing and account management. I have
            overcome many challenges in my professional career and I am
            confident that web development will be a challenging and exciting
            new experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time I like spending time with my three dogs and my
            fianc√©. I enjoy hiking and camping, knitting and crocheting and
            cooking. I also enjoy spending time with family and friends and
            playing board games.
